# Time On test
5-6 Hours (Mainly due to my lack of knowledge of the jquery library)

# Task 1
* Pretty ok just needed to apply the migrations to have some fun around, really liked the authentication flow.

# Task 2
* Cool task here, Linq is awesome I needed to use some time just because I way more used to using SQL within Dapper

# Task 3
* Also just a quick fix on the constructor in order to match the assertion

# Task 4
* This is conflicting for me, I have only found two ways to do so, change the cshtml or annotated the model, both made me mad because I was repeating myself but I decided to annotate the class in order to not change ALL cshtml files

# Task 5
* Here I needed to do some googling on JS tricks, my first approach was make a request but I found it unnecessary, so It was kinda hard because I never used Jquery and Razor but it was fun. 

# Task 6
* This task I needed to change the objects in memory on order to perform a "light" left join, again way used to SQL way but not as hard to think a solution here.

# Task 7
* Nothing much to say here, just needed a flag to perform the ordering

# Task 8
* This is a fun one, I have used Polly to perform the retry police in that case and also I have to say thanks to my references here:
  Przemysław Michalik, after developing(especially after Task 10) my solution I had the curiosity to go through the forks and Przemysław fork had a REALLY similar approach.

# Task 9
* On this bootstrap saved me to be honest

# Task 10
* This one I couldn't make, my lack of knowledge here have not permitted me to find a solution to perform the ordering, I was able to perform the update with asp action and with a js endpoint but I was really doubtfully on how to select the current value and to auto-hide the save button, so I preferred to send you guys only with 9 tasks and not 10 even tough other guys had awesome solutions in the forks I didn't want to copy anyone on this.
